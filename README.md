Test task
===============

* Setup SF2.8 project
* Test task is Image gallery with simple structure - Album -> Images
* Albums and images can be loaded from fixtures. Create/edit parts for album and images are NOT required, but welcome
* Users functionality is NOT needed

We expect:

- 5 albums to be loaded
- First album should contain 5 images
- Every other album should contain 20+ images

Ajax GET albums with max 10 images for albums list - we test good skills in SQL

Ajax GET images when looking on Album in details

Images list should contain maximum 10 images

If album has more than 10 images - pagination should be visible, clicking on the page - images list should be changed.

We expect usage of knp paginator bundle and  serializer

The site should be realized in single-page way, driven by Marionette.js with following routes:
```
‘’ : albums list
‘/album/:id’ : images list for album with id specified, page 1
‘/album/:id/page/:page’ : images list for album with id specified, page :page
```
We expect to see usage of Application, Router, Controller, LayoutVew, CollectionView and ItemView

Each route should be accessible when opening the page having url, means when we open the url in a separate tab - correct content must be loaded

Pages should have a design. Design quality doesn’t matter, we test CSS skills. Any modern decorations are welcome.

Store your code in github/bitbucket!
------------------------
Exclude vendors folder from git project, we will install dependencies using composer.lock

We don’t need your gallery, that is just a test task. If you have samples of your code in github or participation  in other opensource projects - please share a link to github code.

Requirements for PHP code
------------------------
Conform http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html

- we expect definitive variable names, doc-comments
- we expect thin controllers, the business logic must be placed in separate managers, not controllers.
- also we test where and what do u write.
- provide phpunit tests, we expect usage of mock objects.

Please don’t be lazy and make easy-to-understand structure, well separated.

We don’t limit you by time. Provide a well coded project, that’s only thing we require as a result. Please ensure that the code likes at least for you, don’t waste your time otherwise.

Requirements for javascript
------------------------
has to be written on coffeeScript

Requirements for css
------------------------
none, but we suggest to write on scss (compass)

We test skills:
------------------------

- Repository usage, understanding the difference between controllers and other services
- Data structure, hierarchy, code optimizations
- Git knowledge
- Understanding mysql
- Javascript, jquery, coffee, backbone/marionette skills, understanding ajax
